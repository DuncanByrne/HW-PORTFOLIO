# HW2-PORTFOLIO

In this homework we were asked to design a portfolio about ourselves as programmers. 
In my portfolio I listed a few projects I have worked on so whoever is viewing it has a 
better understanding of what I have done. 

We were given this task to show ourselves  and our work, to recruiters for future jobs.
I started with using basic HTML and progressing into the CSS work. After this added :hover to some of my images
within the portfolio, so when the user hovered their mouse over the image they would get a direct link to the website.
